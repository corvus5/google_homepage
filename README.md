This is a beginner html/css project to create the basic view of the Google.com search page. In this project I am not attempting to build a working search page, but rather just design a page that looks like the Google search page. 

At the completion of this project I should have demonstrated my ability to use basic HTML and CSS to style a page including creating a form element and positioning div elements. 

This project is from The Odin Project's Web Development 101 curriculum:(http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
